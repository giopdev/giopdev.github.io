## Systems Security Researcher at [ASTeRiSC Research Lab](https://asteriscresearchlab.com/)
## TA and Computer Science Senior at ASU

### Hello, I'm Giovanni

I'm currently a senior in Computer Science at Arizona State university with a love for low-level computing and the practical application of computer systems that protect users. Throughout my time at university, I have found joy in the many late nights of hammering away at complex problems. Many of these problems currently come from my systems security research in the ASTeRiSC Research Lab under the guidance of Professor Adil Ahmad.

Beyond my technical aspects, I also am a strong advocate for privacy and security in everyday life. As technology becomes less privacy respecting, I find it important to keep an ethical and human-centered view throughout my work. In addition, I also am a huge fan of open-source software and have been daily-driving Linux for years. I also enjoy hosting servers and working on software that improves experiences for others. Here's my favorite personal [project](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3389781770), a software modification I made with over 15,000 active users and a 5-star rating that I still tend to.


### Research

My research interests lie in cybersecurity with a particular focus on systems security. I've developed a passion for these topics through not only taking coursework such as computer systems security, and computer and network forensics, but also using that foundational coursework to propel my research.

My current research is on the mutual isolation of user's systems and game protection software. There exists an arms race in online games where users are increasingly malicious, and in response game companies employ increasingly invasive kernel space protections. This creates a system in which both parties share the same space, but neither party trusts the other. To tackle this my research offers a solution through virtualization that divides the system into two sections for the game itself and the remainder of the user's operating system. This allows for a system in which trust is no longer needed, and the game environment can still leverage the same level of protection it has in a bare-metal configuration. This research is slated for a top conference submission in January.

My time in research has fostered my curiosity and ability to learn complex topics. From understanding and modifying complex code-bases like QEMU, to twice-weekly seminars, reviews, and presentations of cutting-edge research, I sharpened my critical thinking and communication skills. One specific skill I've mastered by this point is finding answers, whether that's not being afraid to ask a question, or rummaging through technical papers and documentation, I always forge a path towards understanding.
